## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21**:
    ```bash
    java -version
    # Expected output: openjdk version "21.x.x"
    ```
*   **Apache Maven**:
    ```bash
    mvn -v
    # Expected output: Apache Maven 3.x.x
    ```
*   **PostgreSQL**: A running PostgreSQL instance and a database created for the application.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/KinetoLandingPage.git
    cd KinetoLandingPage
    ```

2.  **Configure your database**:
    Create a `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file if it doesn't exist, and configure your PostgreSQL connection:
    ```properties
    # src/main/resources/application.properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database_name
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # Use 'create' or 'create-drop' for fresh setups
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    ```
    _Replace `your_database_name`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with your PostgreSQL credentials._

3.  **Build the project**:
    Use Maven to build the project and download all necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

### Running the Project

You can run the Spring Boot application in a few ways:

1.  **Run directly from Maven**:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

2.  **Run the compiled JAR file**:
    After building the project (`mvn clean install`), you'll find an executable JAR in the `target/` directory (e.g., `KinetoWebsite-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`).
    ```bash
    java -jar target/KinetoWebsite-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

Once the application starts, it will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## 💡 Usage

Upon successful launch, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

*   **Homepage**: Provides an overview of the physiotherapist's practice.
*   **Services**: Details the treatments and services offered.
*   **Price List**: Presents a clear breakdown of costs for various services.
*   **Contact**: Includes a form or details for clients to get in touch.

If an administrative panel is implemented, you might be able to access it via a specific URL (e.g., `/admin`) and log in with pre-configured credentials (or create them upon first run if auto-setup is enabled).
